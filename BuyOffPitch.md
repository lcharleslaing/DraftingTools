# Engineering Drafting Dashboard

### Unified Tool for Project, Configuration, and Print Package Management

## Overview

The **Engineering Drafting Dashboard** is designed to simplify and unify our entire drafting and design documentation workflow.
It brings together **project tracking**, **product configuration**, and **print-package management** into a single, easy-to-use desktop app built for real-world production environments.

This tool helps our team **save time**, **reduce errors**, and **stay consistent** across every job‚Äîfrom the first redline to final release.

---

## Core Purpose

Our drafting and design process currently touches multiple systems, folders, and manual checklists.
The goal of this app is to bring those scattered steps into **one organized workspace** that:

* Tracks every job and its workflow stages.
* Centralizes heater, tank, and pump configuration data.
* Manages print packages and drawing sets.
* Automates documentation, review, and release workflows.
* Provides a direct bridge to D365 and Inventor systems.
* Ensures the entire team operates from the same live data.

## Key Features

### üîπ 1. Dashboard

* A **central home screen** showing live job counts, active configurations, and print packages.
* One-click access to Projects, Product Configurations, and Print Packages.
* Clean visual layout, responsive for large displays.
* Quick view of which tasks are in progress and who‚Äôs assigned.

### üîπ 2. Project Manager

* Tracks every job from **initial redline** to **release to Dee**.
* Shows completion dates, due dates, and designer/engineer assignments.
* Automatic duration calculations and progress tracking.
* Built-in shortcuts to open job folders, customer directories, and key documents.
* Ensures no job gets lost in email threads or shared drives.

### üîπ 3. Product Configurations

* Stores configuration details for heaters, tanks, and pumps.
* Dropdowns and data fields for all key specs ‚Äî parameters, fittings, drawing numbers.
* Autosaves changes immediately so data isn‚Äôt lost.
* Links configurations directly to project numbers for full traceability.
* Prepares configuration data for **Inventor integration** (see enhancement below).

### üîπ 4. Print Package Management

* Searches and organizes drawings by job.
* Allows batch printing, PDF conversion, and printer selection.
* Imports/exports full print-package sets for re-use.
* Detects paper sizes and selects the correct printer automatically.
* Greatly reduces time spent assembling and printing drawing sets.

### üîπ 5. Admin Controls (App Order Manager)

* Controls which modules appear on the dashboard and in what order.
* Exports/imports setup in JSON format for quick backup or sharing.
* Automatically performs data backups on exit.

## Benefits for the Team

| Area                 | Before                                    | After                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Project Tracking** | Excel sheets, folders, and manual updates | Centralized interface with live status    |
| **Redline Workflow** | Hard to tell who has what and what‚Äôs done | Clear progress tracking per stage         |
| **Data Entry**       | Repetitive typing and version mismatches  | Unified forms, shared database            |
| **Print Packages**   | Manual file hunting and printing          | Auto-assembled sets with printer profiles |
| **Backup/Recovery**  | Risk of lost data                         | Automatic backups and JSON exports        |

## Benefits for Management

* **Visibility:** See project status, workload distribution, and bottlenecks at a glance.
* **Accountability:** Each job and stage is timestamped and assigned.
* **Efficiency:** Saves hours per job in coordination and document prep.
* **Standardization:** Everyone works from the same data, forms, and naming rules.
* **Scalability:** Future-ready for cloud sync, reporting, and role-based access.

## New Enhancements (Phase 2+)

### üî∏ 1. D365 Bill of Material Interface

* A dedicated **BOM interface** directly aligned with the D365 upload process.
* Engineers and drafters can review, edit, and validate BOM data before submission.
* The app will:

  * Pull live part and assembly data from our shared database.
  * Allow grouping, quantity edits, and unit conversions.
  * Automatically format and export BOM files to match D365 import templates.
  * Track upload history by project for audit and traceability.
* **Goal:** Eliminate manual Excel-based uploads, reduce entry errors, and speed up the ‚ÄúBOM Entry‚Äù workflow stage.

### üî∏ 2. Inventor Integration for Heater, Tank, and Pump Configurations

* Each configuration form (Heater/Tank/Pump) will tie directly into **Autodesk Inventor** using iLogic automation.
* The app will:

  * Pass configuration parameters into Inventor templates.
  * Automatically generate new models or drawings based on selected specs.
  * Save versions and maintain a version history (with user, date, and configuration snapshot).
  * Sync configuration data back into the database for future reuse or comparison.
* **Goal:** Provide a true **Configure-to-Design** workflow ‚Äî where engineering rules and CAD outputs are managed from one interface.

---

## Technical Summary (Plain English)

* Desktop app built using **modern web technology (Next.js + Electron)**.
* Runs entirely on Windows PCs with **no internet requirement**.
* Uses a **local database (SQLite)** for reliability and speed.
* Automatically creates **backups and JSON exports** for recovery.
* Fully compatible with future integration to:

  * Microsoft **D365** (via file or API).
  * Autodesk **Inventor** (via iLogic or COM automation).

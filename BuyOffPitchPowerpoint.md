# 🧩 Engineering Drafting Dashboard

### Unifying Project, Configuration & Print-Package Management

---

## 🚀 Purpose

A single, modern desktop platform that unites **Engineering & Drafting workflows**:
projects, product configurations, and print-package operations — all in one place.

✅ Faster project turnaround
✅ Consistent data and naming
✅ Automated document flow
✅ Clear visibility from start to release

## ⚙️ Core Modules

### **1. Dashboard**

* Central home screen for all tools.
* Live counts: jobs, configurations, print packages.
* Quick access to every workflow area.
* Full-screen layout optimized for production monitors.

### **2. Project Manager**

* Tracks every stage: *Initial Redline → Release to Dee.*
* Displays assignments, dates, and durations.
* Opens job and customer folders instantly.
* Ensures no job is missed or duplicated.

### **3. Product Configurations**

* Structured entry for heater, tank, and pump data.
* Autosave prevents lost updates.
* Linked directly to job numbers for full traceability.
* Future-ready for Inventor automation.

### **4. Print Package Management**

* Organize, search, and batch-print drawings.
* Converts DWG/IDW to PDF automatically.
* Maps printer preferences per paper size.
* Reduces manual printing time dramatically.

### **5. Admin Controls**

* Manage dashboard layout, app order, and module activation.
* Export/import configuration as JSON.
* Auto-backup on close for safe recovery.

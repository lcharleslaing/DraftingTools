# Quick Fix for Git Permission Error

## Immediate Solution

### Disable Cursor's Auto-Fetch (Easiest Fix):

1. **In Cursor**, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open Command Palette
2. Type: `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`
3. Add this line:
   ```json
   "git.autofetch": false,
   "git.fetchOnPull": false
   ```
4. **Save and restart Cursor**

### Or Use Settings UI:
1. Press `Ctrl+,` to open Settings
2. Search for: `git autofetch`
3. **Uncheck "Git: Auto Fetch"**
4. Also uncheck "Git: Fetch On Pull" 
5. Restart Cursor

## What I've Already Done:

✅ Created `.onedriveignore` file to exclude `.git` folder from OneDrive
✅ Opened Windows Storage Settings for you to configure OneDrive

## Important Note:

**This error is SAFE TO IGNORE** - it's just Cursor trying to fetch in the background. Your actual Git commands (`git status`, `git push`, `git pull`) will work fine.

The error appears because:
- Cursor tries to auto-fetch Git updates
- OneDrive is syncing the `.git` folder
- They conflict and OneDrive locks the file

**Solution:** Disable auto-fetch = problem solved!

# Update Log — 2025-10-22 — DB and Stability Improvements

## Summary
This update improves database performance and integrity, hardens counters, and fixes several bugs in Projects and Product Configurations. It also introduces a small DB helper to ensure consistent SQLite PRAGMAs across connections.

## Changes

### Database
- Enable PRAGMAs on initialization (foreign keys, WAL, sync):
  - DraftingTools/database_setup.py
- Add idempotent indexes to speed up frequent queries (projects, workflow, drawings/print-packages, D365 tables):
  - DraftingTools/database_setup.py
- Add ON DELETE CASCADE to foreign keys so child rows are removed with their project:
  - DraftingTools/database_setup.py (workflow tables, drawings, print packages, D365 tables)
- New helper to standardize connections with PRAGMAs:
  - DraftingTools/db_utils.py

### Dashboard
- Use `get_connection()` for PRAGMAs per-connection.
- Guard counters when tables may not exist (heater_configurations, d365_import_configs, project_checklist_status).
- Remove unprofessional placeholder comment.
  - DraftingTools/dashboard.py

### Print Package
- Use `get_connection()` for the primary connection.
  - DraftingTools/print_package.py

### Print Package Workflow
- Use `get_connection()` for DB access.
  - DraftingTools/print_package_workflow.py

### Product Configurations
- Fix autosave variable names so changes persist correctly:
  - flanges_316_var, gauge_cocks_var, packaging_type_var, gas_type_var
  - DraftingTools/product_configurations.py

### Projects
- Keep a durable reference to the details frame and stop indexing child widgets for specs updates.
- Fix context menu mappings to actual script names:
  - print_packages → print_package.py
  - drafting_checklist → drafting_items_to_look_for.py
- Remove call to nonexistent `DatabaseManager.close()` during reset.
  - DraftingTools/projects.py

## Rationale
- PRAGMAs and indexes improve responsiveness and reduce locking in a desktop app with frequent reads.
- FK cascades prevent orphan rows and simplify cleanup logic.
- Guarding counters avoids confusing errors when tables are missing.
- Fixes in Projects/Product Configs address regressions causing slowdowns and broken actions.

## Notes / Caveats
- SQLite does not retroactively add CASCADE to existing tables. Existing databases will not inherit cascade behavior without a migration. If needed, we can add a migration to rebuild affected tables with cascades and copy data.
- Some modules still use raw `sqlite3.connect()`; adopting `db_utils.get_connection()` elsewhere (Projects, Settings, Monitor) would ensure PRAGMAs are always applied.

## Suggested Next Steps
- Convert remaining modules to use `db_utils.get_connection()`.
- Add structured logging and replace generic `except:` blocks in Projects.
- Consider normalizing `print_package_files` stage paths into `(review_id, stage, path)` rows.
- Optionally provide a migration script to retrofit cascades into an existing DB.

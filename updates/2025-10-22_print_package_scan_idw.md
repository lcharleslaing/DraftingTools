# Update Log — 2025-10-22 — Print Package: Scan .idw Directory

## Summary
Added a new action to the Print Package app to index Inventor `.idw` drawings from a chosen directory into a global index, making them searchable under Global Search and addable to any job’s print package.

## User‑Visible Changes
- New button in Print Package → Drawings actions: `Scan .idw Directory`.
- Prompts for a directory (defaulting to `C:\$WorkingFolder\Jobs F\STANDARDS`) and recursively scans for `.idw` files.
- Scanned drawings appear in Global Search results with job number shown as `GLOBAL`.
- Right‑click on a global search result → `Add to Current Job` to insert it into the current job’s package.

## Implementation
- File: `print_package.py`
  - Database init: creates `global_drawings` table if missing (unique on `drawing_path`).
  - UI: adds `Scan .idw Directory` button in the action bar.
- Logic: `scan_idw_directory()` walks selected directory, `INSERT OR IGNORE` each `.idw` into `global_drawings` with metadata.
  - Search: `search_global_drawings()` now combines results from `drawings` and `global_drawings`, deduplicating by path and preferring job‑attached entries.
  - Add to job: `add_drawing_from_global()` supports both job‑attached and `GLOBAL` entries by reading from the appropriate table.

## Rationale
- Provide a quick way to build a global catalog of available Inventor drawings independent of specific jobs, while keeping job packages stored per‑job in the existing `drawings` table. Scans are global only; no auto‑attachment to jobs.

## Testing / Validation Steps
1. Open Print Package: `python print_package.py`.
2. Click `Scan .idw Directory`, choose a directory with `.idw` files; confirm scan summary shows added/skipped counts.
3. Use `Global Search` to find known `.idw` names; entries from the scan show job number `GLOBAL`.
4. Select a job in the left pane, then right‑click a global search result and choose `Add to Current Job`; verify the drawing appears in Current Job Drawings and is saved in the database.

## Notes
- No schema changes to existing `drawings` table; a new `global_drawings` table stores scanned files without requiring a job number.
- Duplicate paths are ignored on re‑scan via `INSERT OR IGNORE`.
- Only `.idw` files are indexed at this time. A `.dwg` option can be added later if needed.
